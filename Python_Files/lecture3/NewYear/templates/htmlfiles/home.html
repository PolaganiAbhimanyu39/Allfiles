 {# - comment: {% %} - this syntax is used to specify to django here comes a condition #}
 {#    we must write "{% endif %}" after the if block(includes not only if condition but else and elif conditions also) ends. " #}
 {# Since, css is a static file(it's doesn't even if it's newyear or not font and it's properties will remain the same right.), we write the command {% load static%} to load them django makes optimizations for these static files #}
 {# Observe that inside 'href' we've written {% static 'path' %} coz it's easier for django to figure out path #}
